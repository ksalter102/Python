for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print("i is now {}".format(i))


#i can be used for anything when using range - this will print 1 - 20
# if range (0, 10, 2) the 2 will step over two times e.g 0,2,4,6,8
# for neagtive range (10, 0, -2), 10,8,6,4,2- stark at first number, work towards second, with third as step
# range will print up to but not include last value e.g 1, 20 wont print 20







# "i" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# It is common practice to use i in for loops. This is just what programmers are used to.
# It may relate to the concept of dimension in 3D space in mathematics.
# The 3 mutual orthogonal unit vectors i, j and k represent the row, column and depth of a 3D array.
