# USE DEBUGGER TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING!

# SUM --------------
# sum(iterable, /, start=0)
# Sums start and the items of an iterable from left to right and returns the total. The iterableâ€™s items are normally numbers, and the start value is not allowed to be a string.
#
# For some use cases, there are good alternatives to sum().
# The preferred, fast way to concatenate a sequence of strings is by calling ''.join(sequence).
# To add floating point values with extended precision, see math.fsum().
# To concatenate a series of iterables, consider using itertools.chain().
